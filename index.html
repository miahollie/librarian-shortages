    <h1>In the Bronx, librarians are hard to come by</h1>

    <h2>Decades of research suggest librarians help students improve their reading and writing skills, so why do the borough's public schools barely have any?</h2>

        <p>Less than 20 percent of public schools in the Bronx budgeted for a library media specialist this school year, according to a recent analysis by the New York City New Service.</p>

        <p>This means that there are approximately 5 librarians for every 10,000 students in a borough that is home to some of the city's largest school districts.</p>

        <iframe title="Librarian employment rate at Bronx public schools, by district" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-O6rQ6" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/O6rQ6/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="795" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>

        <p>District 10, which serves parts of Riverdale, Kingsbridge, Fordham and University Heights, had the highest percentage of school librarians. District 8, which serves the southernmost regions of the Bronx, like Hunts Point and Throgs Neck, had the lowest.</p>  

        <p>The shortage of library media specialists leaves Bronx youth restricted in how they engage with books and reading. Just last month, the city slashed the New York Public Library and Department of Education's budgets by 5 percent, further constricting the agencies' abilities to provide library resources. Parents and educators say the shortages will only steepen reading comprehension disparities among young people.</p>

        <p>"The library was a safe haven," said Candace Hosannah, 40, a home-health aide and mother of six children, three of whom attend P.S. 126 in the Highbridge neighborhood of the Bronx. "A lot of the resources we had growing up, kids don't have anymore."</p>

        <p>The mid-year budget cuts will also impact the New York City Department of Education, with some city council districts in the Bronx estimated to lose as much as $7 million in funding, according to the <a href=https://www.uft.org/get-involved/uft-campaigns/fight-mayors-budget-cuts/enrollment-based-budget-cuts target="blank">United Federation of Teachers</a>.</p>

        <p>And in addition to reducing hours at its locations, the New York Public Library plans to limit its spending on library materials, programming and building maintenance, according to a statement published on the NYPL website.</p>

        <p>"Every year it's kind of like, will there be money?" said Nijma Esad, a researcher and Library Manager of District of Columbia Public Schools. Like New York City, public schools in Washington, D.C. are also governed by mayoral control.</p>

        <p>"Currently, for this school year, we are fully funded," she said. "We don't know what the status of school librarians will be next year."</p>

        <p>New York State <a href=https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Document/I365268f5c22211ddb29d8bee567fca9f?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&bhcp=1 target="blank">law</a> requires secondary schools to employ a certified school librarian. The state does not, however, require elementary schools to do so. Yet in the Bronx, elementary schools employ a higher percentage of librarians than middle schools and high schools.</p>

        <iframe title="Elementary schools employ librarians at a higher rate than other types of schools" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-gCpGr" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gCpGr/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>

        <p>One of those elementary schools is the Highbridge School in District 9, where Roseanna Gulisano, 70, served as a librarian for more than two decades before retiring earlier this year. She says she still works closely with the elementary school to hold book and clothing drives because of the students' needs. </p>

        <p>"There's so much the community needs," she said. "So, I'm not actually a school librarian. I am a -- I guess what I'd call it is an outreach librarian."</p>

        <p>Gulisano's approach to teaching -- doing read-alouds that expose students to engaging texts -- is equally essential in learning how to read, according to a study published by the <a href=https://www.ala.org/aasl/sites/ala.org.aasl/files/content/advocacy/research/docs/AASL_ClassIIResearch_Summary-LETTER.pdf target="blank">American Library Association</a>. Without this mode of instruction, researchers say "explicit teaching of phonological skills and word study" is insufficient.</p>
